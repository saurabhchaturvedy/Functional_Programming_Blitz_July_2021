As while creating static factories of Airplanes , when we filter on airline type , we need to provide airline type as an argument value , and lets
suppose later in the day , we want to filter by the fuelLevel , then we create one more method to accomplish that .

So what we are doing is just passing the arguments as values , idea is the pass the behavior how to select the object for
storing into airplane1 list , and then test the criteria against each of the Airplane object .

If it passes the criteria ,

push object to the list

else

discard object

Main idea to understand is :

We want to pass the behaviour as an argument , not state (i.e fuelLevel , or airline)
